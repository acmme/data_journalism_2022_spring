## Introduction

Consider this a personal guide to the commands and functions you will learn. In general, when you come across an R command or function that you want to remember, put it in here along with a description of what it does and when you'd use it.

## Installed Packages

>tidyverse

## Jan. 27

Set working directory = setwd("#").
Code block = ``` and then {r} and then ```.
Load a library = library(#).

```{r}
setwd("~/Github/data_journalism_2022_spring")

library(tidyverse)

## Feb. 1

arrange in ascending order = arrange().
arrange in descending order = arrange(desc()).
setting a variable = var <- code #preferable
setting a variable = code -> var 
  ex:
  
```{r}
  var <- ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  summarise(
    count_loans = n(),
    total_loans_amount = sum(amount)
  ) %>%
  arrange(total_loans_amount)
  
```

add/replace/change a column = mutate(column_name = value/object).
value = number.
value = 'word'.
make all values in a column uppercase = str_to_upper(column_name).
show me specific columns A, B, and C = select(column_A, column_B, column_C).
